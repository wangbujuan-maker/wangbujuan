# Collaborative Area Coverage Method for UAV Swarm under Complex Boundary Conditions: A Regional Division Approach
The code in this repository provides data support for the paper "Collaborative Area Coverage Method for UAV Swarm under Complex Boundary Conditions: A Regional Division Approach", which has been published on the journal "The Visual Computer".   
The following describes the functions of important scriptsï¼š  
Hungarian algorithm script: The partition algorithm used in this article is used to calculate partitions.  
STC2:Used to calculate the path of the spanning tree algorithm.  
mstc, mean, compar: We can obtain real-time information on the calculation time, driving distance, and other data of the three agents in the console for the coverage experiments of the three methods. Exporting the data to Excel can complete the information acquisition.
